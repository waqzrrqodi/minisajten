          <h2>What is quantum computers?</h2>
          <hr class="small-break">
          <p>A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of classical bits to store and process information. Unlike classical bits, which can be in one of two states (0 or 1), qubits can exist in multiple states at once, known as superposition. Additionally, qubits can become "entangled" with other qubits, meaning that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, even if they are separated by large distances.

            These properties of qubits allow quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, a quantum computer can factor large numbers exponentially faster than a classical computer, which could have significant implications for encryption and cryptography.
            
            To build a quantum computer, scientists use a variety of physical systems as qubits, including atoms, ions, superconducting circuits, and more. Once qubits are created, they need to be controlled and manipulated by applying electromagnetic fields, laser light, and other techniques.
            
            To perform a calculation, a series of quantum gates, which are the equivalent of classical logic gates, are applied to the qubits. The output of a quantum computation is read out by measuring the state of the qubits.
            
            Due to the nature of quantum mechanics, a quantum computation is probabilistic and the outcome of a single run of the algorithm is generally not deterministic. To increase the accuracy of results, the computation is repeated multiple times, and the statistics of the results are analyzed.
            
            It's important to note that while quantum computers have the potential to be much faster than classical computers for certain types of problems, they still have a ways to go before they will be able to replace classical computers in all cases. Additionally, they are still very expensive and difficult to build and maintain.
          
            To perform quantum computation, a physical system is used to implement the qubits, the quantum gates and the measurement process. 
            Many different physical systems can be used to implement qubits, such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and topological qubits. 
            Each physical system has its own advantages and disadvantages, and research is ongoing to find the best qubit technology for building a large-scale, practical quantum computer.
            However, the development of full-scale quantum computers is still in its infancy and there are still many challenges that need to be overcome. 
            One of the main challenges is the problem of decoherence, which occurs when the qubits interact with their environment and lose their quantum properties. 
            This can cause errors in the computation and limit the performance of the quantum computer.</p>
