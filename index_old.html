    <h1>Supercomputers</h1>
    <p>A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance compared to a general-purpose computer. Supercomputers are used for highly calculation-intensive tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling, and physical simulations.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Supercomputers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>IBM Summit (United States)</li>
      <li>Sunway TaihuLight (China)</li>
      <li>Frontera (United States)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Quantum Computers</h1>
    <p>Quantum computers are a type of computer that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, but are also more difficult to build and program.</p>
    <h2>Examples of Quantum Computers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>IBM Q System One (United States)</li>
      <li>Google Bristlecone (United States)</li>
      <li>Honeywell Quantum Computer (United States)</li>
    </ul>
